We rehearse once a week and perform four Sunday afternoon concerts in Palos Verdes.  New players of almost any band instrument from bassoon to bells are welcome. Some of our members also play in other groups, and some enjoy practicing their skills with their second or third instrument.  Skill levels range from moderate to excellent. If you enjoy rehearsing and performing a variety of concert band music in a relaxed community atmosphere, we’d like to hear from you.

Guests and prospective players are welcome anytime to come and listen, or to bring an instrument and rehearse with us. Rehearsals are held from 7:30pm to 10:00pm, Wednesday nights at Los Angeles Harbor College.  Harbor College (1111 Figueroa Place, Wilmington, CA 90744) is accessible from the southbound Harbor Freeway at the Anaheim Street exit.  Turn north on Figueroa Place to West ‘L’ Street and turn west.  From Anaheim Street, turn north at Figueroa Place.   Enter the parking area across from the Music Building on ‘L’ Street.  The rehearsal is in Room 107 in the Music Building.
